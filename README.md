# Koopey

A location-based transaction platform for peer-to-peer interactions. Think of a modern headless cms, similar to WordPress that can be applied universally to distributors, dating, taxis, shops, and restaurants. There is a list of widgets that can be filtered, messaged, and purchased. The platform makes use of modern technologies such as Android, Angular, Docker, GraphQL, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and  Spring Boot. The transaction and the transport of the asset from source to destination is regarded as the same process, making the model simple and adaptable to a variety of different applications.
